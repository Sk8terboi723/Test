    <h2><strong>Bryce</strong></h2><p>Bryce has a slow playstyle but is a good overrall player. Bryce is a pussy but considers it "playing smart" because hes just smoking weed and doesn't want to play.</p>
    <br />
    <h2><strong>Matthew</strong></h2><p>Matthew has a very good shot, but his emotions tend to overwhelm him so he ends up eating his microphone and getting off.</p>
    <br />
    <h2><strong>Caesar</strong></h2><p>Caesar is the best player in the game. No one is better than Caesar, he has 100% accuracy and wins every game he plays.</P>
